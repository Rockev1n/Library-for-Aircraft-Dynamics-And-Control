## Contents

- [**Axes transformation**](axes_transformations)  
Here there are functions and Simulink blocks based on them, with which different
types of coordinate transformations can be calculated.
This includes Euler angles, quaternions and rotation matrices.
- [**Interfaces external programs**](interfaces_external_programs)  
Interfaces external programs contains various interfaces to external programs
e.g. for visualization of the flight state or for implementation of controllers in ArduPilot.
- [**Unit conversions**](unit_conversions)  
Unit conversions contains Matlab functions and Simulink blocks to convert units.
- [**Quaternions**](quaternions)  
Elementary collection of functions for calculating quaternions, angular distances and rotation vectors.
