# Propulsion

The propulsion library is part of LADAC and contains functions and Simulink blocks related to propulsion modules.
Motors and servos are located in the [actuators](../actuators) library.


## Contents

- [**Battery**](battery)  
Contains a dynamic LiPo battery model. However, this is not finished yet (work in progress).
- [**Map-based propeller**](propeller_map-based)  
Contains functions and Simulink blocks to compute the steady thrust and torque by propellers based on a specified map.
