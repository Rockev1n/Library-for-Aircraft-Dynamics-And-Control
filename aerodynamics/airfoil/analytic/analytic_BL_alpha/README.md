# Analytic airfoil coefficients with Beddoes-Leishman model

The model can yield good results for angles of attack between -5°
and 25°.
The implementation was not finished it only contains the "normal force
coefficient" which is close to the lift coefficient for small angles of
attack as well as the pitching moment coefficient.

## Tests

Run the test script to get some first results and impressions of how it works:
   ```

   ```
   
## How it works

Please take a look at the function documentation as well as the literature [1].
